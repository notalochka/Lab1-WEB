      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I was born on the 27th of October in 2004 in the town of Kropyvnytskyi.
        My mum used to say that I was independent and purposeful as a child,
        although I don't know if I have these qualities now. However, this
        ambitious girl would never have thought that she would study
        programming. My thoughts about a career varied from teacher to lawyer.
        But one thing I knew for sure was that I never wanted to be a doctor. I
        don't like biology and chemistry...
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I realise that entering Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute was
        one of the best choices I have made in my life. Yes, studying here is
        difficult, you have to find lots of new information yourself... But
        there is no comparison with how many wonderful people you can meet here,
        how many cool teachers you can learn from, how much fun it is to be a
        student here. I think this is where I fit in.
